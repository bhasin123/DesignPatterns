Extract what varies now and in future. Implement them as seperate algorithms. Program via Interface over Implementation. Always avoid Implementation directly. 
Uses Interface Implementation approach. is what principle for Encapsulation.

InShort:
Implement Different Strategies via Same Inteface. Have common Interface for all Strategies. Implement them seperately. Have a context class in which we write a code for setting the strategy 
and calling the strategy from the Interface Property(Composition). Form the main or client class, we can set the strategy and call the strategy via context class.


In This project has implemented various search strategies!
